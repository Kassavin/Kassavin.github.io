# Welcome to my Ethereum DApp portfolio. 

A DApp (Decentralised Application) has its code running on a decentralised network as opposed to a centralised server.

Please ensure you are using a Chrome or Firefox browser. Please install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) and create an account. Once logged in, connect to the Rinkeby Test Network. If you require Ether funds (Rinkeby Test Network), please contact me and I will send you some funds.
